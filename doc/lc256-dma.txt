65c02 DMA with CPLD (untested):
-------------------
Enable DMA: Pull down !DMA from cartridge
- wait till BA gets High (instruction finished, BUS available)
- 65c02 stops after current instruction (when sync appears)
BA=high:
- ROM is disabled
- Full 64KB RAM access up to RAM-speedgrade (current bank, first 1KB always in bank0)

Disable DMA: Remove !DMA=low
- 65c02 continues with next instruction

DMA with GAL (limited, untested):
--------------------
STOP CPU: Pull down !DMA from cartridge
- wait at least 6 cycles (1500ns = maximum instruction length @4MHz)
- 65c02 stops immediately at PHI2=low (even in in write cycles)
Disable buffers: Pull down !BA from cartridge
- ROM is disabled
- Full 64KB RAM access up to RAM-speedgrade (current bank, first 1KB always in bank0)

Enable buffers: remove !BA=low
RUN CPU: Remove !DMA=low
- 65c02 continues at next address with current instruction


6309 DMA is untested and not fully implemented till now!
